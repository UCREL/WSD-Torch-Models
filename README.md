# WSD Torch Models

## Development

### Setup

You can either use the dev container with your favourite editor, e.g. VSCode. Or you can create your setup locally below we demonstrate both.

In both cases they share the same tools, of which these tools are:
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python packaging and development
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (OPTIONAL) for automation of tasks, not strictly required but makes life easier.

#### Dev Container

A [dev container](https://containers.dev/) uses a docker container to create the required development environment, the Dockerfile we use for this dev container can be found at [./.devcontainer/Dockerfile](./.devcontainer/Dockerfile). To run it locally it requires docker to be installed, you can also run it in a cloud based code editor, for a list of supported editors/cloud editors see [the following webpage.](https://containers.dev/supporting)

To run for the first time on a local VSCode editor (a slightly more detailed and better guide on the [VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial)):
1. Ensure docker is running.
2. Ensure the VSCode [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension is installed in your VSCode editor.
3. Open the command pallete `CMD + SHIFT + P` and then select `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`

You should now have everything you need to develop, `uv`, `make`, for VSCode various extensions like `Pylance`, etc.

If you have any trouble see the [VSCode website.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial).

#### Local

To run locally first ensure you have the following tools installed locally:
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for Python packaging and development. (version `0.9.9`)
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (OPTIONAL) for automation of tasks, not strictly required but makes life easier.
  * Ubuntu: `apt-get install make`
  * Mac: [Xcode command line tools](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/4) includes `make` else you can use [brew.](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make)
  * Windows: Various solutions proposed in this [blog post](https://earthly.dev/blog/makefiles-on-windows/) on how to install on Windows, including `Cygwin`, and `Windows Subsystem for Linux`.

When developing on the project you will want to install the Python package locally in editable format with all the extra requirements, this can be done like so:

```bash
uv sync
```

### Running linters and tests

This code base uses isort, flake8 and mypy to ensure that the format of the code is consistent and contain type hints. ISort and mypy settings can be found within [./pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) and the flake8 settings can be found in [./.flake8](./.flake8). To run these linters:

``` bash
make lint
```

To run the tests with code coverage (**NOTE** these are the code coverage tests that the Continuos Integration (CI) reports at the top of this README):

``` bash
make tests
```

### Setting a different default python version

The default or recommended Python version is shown in [.python-version](./.python-version, currently `3.10`, this can be changed using the [uv command](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python-pin):

``` bash
uv python pin
# uv python pin 3.13
```
